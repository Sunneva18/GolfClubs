# Overview of Iceland's golf clubs

I decided to make an app showcasing Iceland's many golf clubs and courses. I decided on this as it was an idea from my boyfriend and I couldn't think of anything else. Given more time I probably could come up with something better but for now this is what you're stuck with. :D

## Running the app

To run the app the first thing to do install the node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

I used Expo to view the app and I definitely recommend doing the same! You can either download the Expo app to your phone ('Expo Go' in the app store) or use the iOS simulator available in XCode.
Either way you use:

```bash
npm start
```

and from there you get options on how you want to proceed, you can simply press 'i' to run the app in iOS simulator or scan the QR code on your phone camera to open the app in your phone.
